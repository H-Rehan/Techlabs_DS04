# Loan Lens

We created a model that predicts loan defaults to help lenders minimize their risks. 

# Description

This project addresses the challenge of predicting loan defaults 
using Lending Club data. We employed data preprocessing, 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to 
analyze and predict loan statuses. Through feature engineering 
and the application of various algorithms, we identified significant 
factors contributing to loan defaults. The project findings offer 
valuable insights for financial institutions to improve their risk 
assessment processes and reduce the likelihood of loan defaults. 

# Key Features

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of loan status
distributions, correlation matrices, and feature relationships.
• Predictive Modeling: Application of machine learning algorithms like
Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Forest Classifier to
predict loan default probabilities.
• Feature Engineering: Identification of key factors such as loan grade,
interest rate, and employment length that significantly influence default
rates.
• Visualization of Insights: Analysis of how employment length and
home ownership status affect loan default rates.
