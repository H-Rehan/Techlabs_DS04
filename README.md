# Loan Lens

We created a model that predicts loan defaults to help lenders minimize their risks. 

# Description

This GitHub repository hosts a series of notebooks dedicated to analyzing
and predicting loan defaults using data from Lending Club, a peer-to-peer
lending platform. The project aims to provide financial institutions with
insights that can improve their risk assessment processes, ultimately
reducing the likelihood of loan defaults. By leveraging a combination of data
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning
models, the notebooks offer a comprehensive look into the factors that
contribute to loan defaults.

# Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of loan status
distributions, correlation matrices, and feature relationships.

Predictive Modeling: Application of machine learning algorithms like
Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Forest Classifier to
predict loan default probabilities.

Feature Engineering: Identification of key factors such as loan grade,
interest rate, and employment length that significantly influence default
rates.

Visualization of Insights: Analysis of how employment length and
home ownership status affect loan default rates.
